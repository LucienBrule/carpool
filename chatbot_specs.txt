Our chatbot should be able to parse certain inputs.

See examples below for the chatbot to distinguish between
	users and drivers.

Maybe create two chatbots so there's no cross-talk (one for drivers and one
	for users). Driver chatbot being a private chatbot while the user chatbot 
	is relatively public.



For [User]s:

	Primary queries:

	- "[need/looking for/can I get] a ride to [place] from [suggested place]"
		-> followup question by chatbot:
				"How many people are in your group (including you)?"

	- "I got picked up by [driver name]"
	- "....don't need a ride...."		("We don't need a ride anymore")


	Secondary queries:
	- 



For [Driver]s:

	Primary queries									examples

	- "....starting...driving shift..." ("I'm starting my driving shift now")
	- "....finished driving..."    		("I've finished driving for the night")
	- "....picked up..."	 		 	("I've just picked up a group")


	Secondary queries
	- "....skipping group..."			("Took too long, skipping group")
